## BethToken

Supply : 1 000 000  
Usecase : Bet and stack

## Bet

Users can bet with the beth token.

## Bet creation

For the moment only Beth team can create a bet and only one bet can be open at the same time.  
In the future, validators will create bet, and multiple bet at the same time will be available.

## Stacking

Become validator by stacking 1000 tokens. Validators are like data providers on an Oracle, they compete with each oser whitout knowing who are the other validators.  
When a bet if finished 20 validators are randomly picked, they have a limited time to validate the bet (pick the winner team1 or team2), the majority wins.  
Validators that don't validate or are against majority are punished on their stack.  
Validators that validate correctly shares 5% of the total bet amount.
